Brackets for Good -- Partners In Housing Scoreboard
===

My hacky Brackets for Good scoreboard for Partners In Housing.

This is just a simple page that scrapes the Brackets for Good website and grabs the score for Partners In Housing and their current competitor. It also plays a sound every time PIH gets a donation.

This is very quick and dirty. I have to manually update the fetch script each round.
